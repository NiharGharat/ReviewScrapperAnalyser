If I was to proceed with the process, I would be paying the higher rent amount each month that is not listed because they are renovating their units. I requested to have my application fee returned (since I would not have applied in the first place) to which I was told yes but they would not be refunding me for the processing charge.

One of them is the fact they can not keep up with the complex in any shape or form. For example water line is turned off literally every other week for a least an hour for repairs.EVERY OTHER WEEK, however they just finished remodeling the office. We have a electrical issue and water pumping issue in one of the buildings that i live in. AC unit was broken, temperature reach as high as 85 degrees. So hot the thermometer on the thermostat couldn’t go any higher. I called the emergency hotline to see if i can get a repair asap. I was told there was nothing they can do until the next morning. That’s was not a good enough answer for me. I had to wait outside at 11:30 at night to get answer back. They offered another apartment to stay in that night, however they said and I quote “It just wouldn’t be clean” are you serious! Again they have the money to renovate the office so nice but can’t keep up with its own unit’s. Reminder that’s just one of the 4 issues i had.\n\nWithin the 1 year I been here water been turned off over 20+ times, have people vandalizing other people Property, Have a gate system that doesn’t work 90% of the time, Front office is completely blind to it all and see nothing wrong at all with anything, so glad I found a better place.', 'no_of_reviews': 'Local Guide·7 reviews'}
